# Hands_On_ML  
  
In this series, I am walking through the theoretical  and applied concepts of the book, **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow** by Aurelien Geron. The choice in this book mainly resides in getting up and running with ML in Python with a more applied approach. I have put my ISLR project on pause as its more theory than application. That said, as and when I touch topics in this project, that need more theory, I'll be looking them up in the ISLR book.  
  
Part 1 of this book is all about ML, while Part 2 is about Neural Networks and Deep Learning. In Part 1, I aim to get accustomed to-  

1. Chapter 1 - Machine Learning Fundamentals
2. Chapter 2 - End-to-End Machine Learning Project
3. Chapter 3 - Classification
4. Chapter 4 - Model Training
5. Chapter 5 - Support Vector Machines
6. Chapter 6 - Decision Trees
7. Chapter 7 - Ensemble Learning and Random Forests
8. Chapter 8 - Dimensionality Reduction
